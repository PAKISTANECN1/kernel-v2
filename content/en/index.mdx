# OP Games

### A curated community of brilliance in web3

We are building an open, peer-to-peer, lifelong network of the most talented individuals in the blockchain space, one block at a time. Each block accommodates 250 individuals and runs for 8 weeks. It is a unique experience.

Together, we are joyfully subverting the status quo.
